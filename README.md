# Getting Started With Alamofire 5

This is a sample project for [Will's post](https://engineering.textnow.com/alamofire-5-is-out-of-beta-how-to-use-it-768da2557501) on TextNow's Engineering blog with the title "An Introduction to Alamofire 5: from CRUD to Authentication". I have implemented both the front end and back end for this project using AWS Lambda functions and API gateway.

## Goals
To give the user a quick taste of Alamofire 5 with Swift.

## Setup Instructions

The project should be ready to go, with no setup instructions needed! The only assumption is that you, the user, have CocoaPods installed (and in the off-chance that you don't, [here's how to get started with CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#toc_3)).
